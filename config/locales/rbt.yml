  sparky_introduction-1: "Oh! You scared me."
  sparky_introduction-2: "I am searching for my siblings; they were gone during my nap."
  sparky_introduction-3A: "Can you help me to find them?"
  sparky_introduction-3B: "Oh! Do you change your mind?" 
  sparky_introduction-4B-N: "Oh, that's too bad."
  sparky_introduction-4A-N: "Oh, I understand you're busy. Sure..."
  sparky_introduction-4-Y: "Oh really! Thank you so much."
  sparky_introduction-5: "So, to begin, you can search in these bushes. I know Scotty always loves to hide in bushes to paint alone."
  sparky_introduction-6: "Oh, you found Scotty. Thank you. Continue to look everywhere to find my other siblings."
  sparky_introduction-7: "If you need information on my siblings, you can ask me. Maybe he will help you to find them."
  sparky_hint-1: "Which one do you want to know more about?"
  sparky_hint-ginny: "Ginny is always hungry. Maybe if you drop a carrot , she will come!"
  sparky_hint-steevie: "Steevie is the youngest; he runs when we shout this name."
  sparky_hint-larry: "Nobody understands what Larry is saying, but he loves to do high fives."
  sparky_hint-sergie: "This is the elder of the group. He loves to keep the young ones on the right path."
  sparky_hint-debbie: "I'm sure Debbie is playing again with this game console somewhere."
  sparky_hint-appie: "She always locks herself in this secret cabin and throws the key. Maybe Appie's key is somewhere in the DOMain."
  sparky_hint-remmy: "Remmy doesn't like small spaces."
  sparky_hint-timmy: "This space is too lighter for Timmy."
  sparky_hint-no-thanks: "Ok, good luck."
  larry_enigma-1A: "Hi, do you understand me?"
  larry_enigma-1B: "Oh, you again? Can you understand me right now?"
  larry_enigma-2-Y: "Oh... really... I can't believe it finally!"
  larry_enigma-2-N: "Huh... but you say 'no' in my language, or it's pure coincidence."
  larry_enigma-2B-O: "Why do you try to talk to me if you can't speak my language?"
  larry_enigma-2A-O: "One more person that doesn't understand me."
  larry_enigma-3: "We're going to be the best bros!"
  api_help: "The API is not here."
  larry_introduction-1: "I'm so happy to find someone who understands me."
  ginny_introduction-1: "This carrot is so tasteful. Thank you!"
  appie_introduction-1: "When I'm not good, I like to hide in my secret cabin."
  remmy_introduction-1: "What happened? I was so scared, the walls began to approach me."
  sergie_introduction-1: "I don't want to see you wandering on dangerous paths again."
  timmy_introduction-1: "I like to hide in the shadow, nobody can see me."
  debbie_introduction-1: "I see you like consoles too. Me? I like playing Zelda games."
  scotty_introduction-1: "I was so peaceful in this bush."
  steevie_introduction-1: "HE HE, it's you who called me?!?! I know many games we can play together!"
  larry_random-1: "Maybe you can teach my language to my other siblings!"
  ginny_random-1: "What do you want? If you think I will share this carrot , it's a no!"
  appie_random-1: "It's my father who built this secret cabin especially for me!"
  remmy_random-1: "I'm claustrophobic; it's like I can breathe less the smaller the space is."
  sergie_random-1: "Be careful, kiddo. Some paths should never be used."
  timmy_random-1: "THE DARKEST CALLED ME!"
  debbie_random-1: "Last time, I finished the game Mario Odyssey; it's a banger."
  scotty_random-1: "I like historical paintings like the Sacre de Napoleon. I want to paint a giant fresco once in my life."
  steevie_random-1: "We can play cards, hide and seek, tag, rock-paper-scissors, the floor is lava..."
  sparky_found-steevie: "Oh, you found Steevie! This little one is an energy pile."
  sparky_found-larry: "You found Larry! So you can speak with him now. Wow!"
  sparky_found-sergie: "Oh, you found Sergie! It doesn't change; always so protective."
  sparky_found-debbie: "You found Debbie! Finally, she's got outside without playing video games."
  sparky_found-timmy: "Oh, you found Timmy! I'm surprising you can get him up in the dark!"
  sparky_found-appie: "You found Appie! Where did you find this key? Tell me? ... No, no, let me find it myself."
  sparky_found-remmy: "Oh, you found Remmy! Please don't do this again; I believe I was going to be crushed."
  sparky_found-ginny: "You found Ginny! I think I will not have a part of this carrot; she never share it with anybody."
  sparky_found-all: "Oh, you found all my siblings! Thank you so much! We can go home back together!"
